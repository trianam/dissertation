\chapter*{Abstract}
\emph{Path planning} problem consists in finding an interpolating curve
between two points in a scene with obstacles. It has significant
applications in robotics and scientific visualization. It is important to
find a curve with certain qualities of smoothing, thus we focus on the
curve fairing. Furthermore, for the representation, we use \bs curves
that are an affirmed standard in \ac{CAD} and \ac{CAGD}.

We design different algorithms to solve the problem and we present their
complexity analysis. The resulting work is highly interdisciplinary:
we address a mixed approach, analytical and stochastic.

We realize an application in
Python using \ac{VTK} for the visualization that implements the
presented algorithms. Finally, we systematically test the application
with different scenarios.
