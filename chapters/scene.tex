\chapter{Scene representation}\label{cha:scene}
The problem of scene description basically consists in fixing a
representation of the obstacles and of the path, besides establishing the structures adopted for their storage.

\section{Basic elements and path}
First of all, since we are interested in spatial path planning, all
the point coordinates are in $\mE^3$. Furthermore, we concentrate
on \bss because we want a standard representation for the output of
the algorithm, the path between a start point $s$ and an end point
$e$. \bs
curves are the standard adopted in \ac{CAD} and
\ac{CAGD} systems \cite{hughes}\cite{foley}. 

The structures that uniquely identify a \bs curve are
three: its degree m, the associated control polygon and the extended
knot vector.

Regarding the degree of the curve, we let 
the users choose among quadratics
($m=2$), cubics ($m=3$) and quartics ($m=4$). The users
choose also the starting and ending points, $s$ and $e$ respectively,
associated to the parameter values $t_0=\dots=t_m$ and
$t_{n+1}=\dots=t_{n+m+1}$.

The number
of vertices and the other vertices themselves come from the algorithm,
and they depend on the position of $s$ and $e$ and on the obstacles, see
\cref{sec:polChain} for details.

The knots are generated automatically using one of the two methods
described in \cref{sec:knotSel}.

Thus, for the curve we memorize only the control vertices $P$ and the
degree 
$m$. As usual, in any computer graphic system, when we want its plotting, we tabulate $\ve{S}$ for a certain
number\footnote{Enough for having a smooth look.} of values of $t$ and
then we draw the polygonal chain that connects them.

\section{Basic obstacle representation}\index{Obstacle}\index{\acf{OTF}}
Besides the curve, in the scene we need to represent the obstacles. We
call $Obs$ the set of all obstacles in scene. We choose to represent
each obstacle $Ob\in Obs$ as a set of triangular faces called
\acp{OTF}, each one containing three vertices. To summarize, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    Obs&=\{Ob_0,\dots,Ob_{\#Obs}\}\\
    Ob_i&=\{Otf_{i,0},\dots,Otf_{i,\#Otf_i}\}&i=0,\dots,\#Obs\\
    Otf_{i,j}&=\{\ve{p_{i,j,0}},\ve{p_{i,j,1}},\ve{p_{i,j,2}}\}\quad\qquad&
    i=0,\dots,\#Obs;\quad j=0,\dots,\#Otf_i
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\#Obs$ is the number of obstacles in the scene and $\#Otf_i$ is
the number of \acp{OTF} in obstacle $Ob_i$.

We choose this specific configuration because this way all the
intersections that can occur are between triangle and triangle or
triangle and segment and they can be easily calculated. This implies
that, if an obstacle is a polyhedron more complex than just a
tetrahedron, its faces must to be preliminarily triangulated.

We provide the methods explained in \cref{sec:complexObs} to
abstract the creation of \acp{OTF}.

Using this solution, we can potentially insert open
polyhedrons\footnote{For instance a tetrahedron without one
  face} or intersecting shapes in the scene, as we do not have
any restriction on the position of the points $\ve{p_{i,j,k}}$.

\section{Complex obstacles}\label{sec:complexObs}
In order to simplify the scene construction, we create four methods to
easily build obstacles:
\begin{itemize}
\item one for tetrahedrons;
\item one for parallelepipeds\footnote{Aligned with the axis.};  
\item a more general one for convex hulls;
\item a special method for a bucket-shaped obstacle that
  we use in the tests.
\end{itemize}

\begin{algo}{Abstract construction of tetrahedron}{alg:tetrahedron}
  \Procedure{buildTetrahedron}{$Obs, \ve{a}, \ve{b}, \ve{c}, \ve{d}$}
  \State $Obs\Ass Obs\cup\{\ \{\ve{a},\ve{b},\ve{c}\},\ \{\ve{a},\ve{b},\ve{d}\},\ \{\ve{b},\ve{c},\ve{d}\},\ \{\ve{c},\ve{a},\ve{d}\}\ \}$
  \EndProcedure
\end{algo}
\begin{algo}{Abstract construction of convex hull
    polyhedron}{alg:convHullPoly}
  \Procedure{buildConvexHullPolyhedron}{$Obs, \ve{p_0},\dots,\ve{p_n}$}
  \State $Ob\Ass\emptyset$
  \State $facets\Ass convexHull(\{\ve{p_0},\dots,\ve{p_n}\})$
  \ForAll{$f\in facets$}
  \State $simplices\Ass triangularize(f)$
  \ForAll{$\{\ve{s_0},\ve{s_1},\ve{s_2}\}\in simplices$}
  \State $Ob\Ass Ob\cup\{\ve{s_0},\ve{s_1},\ve{s_2}\}$
  \EndFor
  \EndFor
  \State $Obs\Ass Obs\cup Ob$
  \EndProcedure
\end{algo}
\cref{alg:tetrahedron} takes the four vertices of a tetrahedron
and adds to $Obs$ a new obstacle that have all the faces of the
unique tetrahedron that can be built with the four
points.

\cref{alg:convHullPoly} is more complex, first we need to build the
convex hull of the input points (see \cite{deberg} and \cite{press}
for details on the 
convex hull algorithm), then we obtain a set of $facets$ that have to
be triangulated (see \cite{deberg} and \cite{press} for details on the
triangularization
algorithms). Finally we add each triangle as a new \ac{OTF} of the
obstacle.

\section{Bounding box}\index{Bounding box}
We also give to the user the possibility of adding a
bounding box around the scene. It is built as an obstacle, using
\acp{OTF}, in fact we provide a method that takes two points $\ve{a}$
and $\ve{b}$ and builds the parallelpiped having those points as
extremes and with
all the faces triangularized like in \cref{fig:boundingBox}.
\begin{myfig}{Bounding box with extremes $\ve{a}$ and $\ve{b}$.}{fig:boundingBox}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \pgfmathsetmacro\front{6}
    \pgfmathsetmacro\side{2}
    \pgfmathsetmacro\sum{\front+\side}

    \coordinate (a) at (0,0);
    \coordinate (o1) at (\front,0);
    \coordinate (o2) at (\sum,\side);
    \coordinate (o3) at (\front,\front);
    \coordinate (o4) at (0,\front);
    \coordinate (o5) at (\side,\sum);
    \coordinate (b) at (\sum,\sum);


    \draw[poly] (a) -- (o1) -- (o3) -- (o4) -- (a);
    \draw[poly] (o1) -- (o2) -- (b) -- (o3);
    \draw[poly] (b) -- (o5) -- (o4);
    \draw[poly] (o4) -- (o1);
    \draw[poly] (b) -- (o1);
    \draw[poly] (b) -- (o4);


    \foreach \p in {o1,o2,o3,o4,o5}
    \filldraw[vertex] (\p) circle (2pt);

    \foreach \p in {a,b}
    \filldraw[vertexHigh] (\p) circle (4pt);

    \foreach \n/\l/\p in {a/a/{below left},b/b/{above
        right},o1/n_1/below,o2/n_2/{below right},o3/n_3/{below
        right},o4/n_4/{left},o5/n_5/{above left}}
    \node[\p] at (\n) {$\ve{\l}$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{myfig}

In regards to the intersections, the \acp{OTF} of the bounding box are
considered exactly like the \acp{OTF} of the obstacles throughout the
whole project. The only differences are
that the bounding box is not visible when the scene is plotted and a
point inside the bounding box is not considered to be inside the obstacle.
